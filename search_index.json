of this demonstration\nThis book chapter is to demonstrate the feasibility of using GitBook for course content delivery. The book was firstly developed in GitBook editor, and then is hosted through Github. We expect to have a simple, concise, free, and easily maintained platform, which can be accessed by anyone who are interested in to deliver a course for either flipped learning or on-line teaching.  For example, during flipped learning, teachers can deliver course contents in this way. Then student can access them before the class room. Compared with current on-line education platforms, such as Udacity or Coursera, users don not need support from IT professional. For simplicity, this platform does not intend to for course management such as grading, submission, or attendance checking.  We want to keep both the interface and the function as simple as possible. More generally, this platform can be viewed as a platform to deliver interactive multimedia text book.\nFor this purpose, we developed the first week course content of introduction to signal processing. Several third party plugins has been tested and installed to enable video, equations, quiz, and code snippet. Through this project, we want reach a conclusion if GitBook similar platform is good for course content delivery? What are current limitations for current GitBook platform? Could we develop a similar platform but can serve users better? \n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"chapter1.html":{"url":"chapter1.html","title":"Week1.
